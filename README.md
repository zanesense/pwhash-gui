# pyhash GUI

A simple GUI application to generate hashed passwords using various hashing algorithms. The application is built using Python's `tkinter` library and supports SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, SHA-512, SHA-384, and SHA-224 hashing algorithms.

## Features

- Input a password and generate its hash using the selected algorithm.
- Supports multiple hashing algorithms: SHA-256, SHA-1, MD5, SHA-512, SHA-384, and SHA-224.
- Copy the generated hash to the clipboard with a single click.

## Prerequisites
